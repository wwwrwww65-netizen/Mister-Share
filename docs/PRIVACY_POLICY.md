# Privacy Policy for Mister Share

**Effective Date:** January 17, 2026

**Mister Share** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Non-Personal Data
Mister Share operates primarily as an **offline peer-to-peer (P2P)** file transfer tool. We do not collect, store, or upload your personal files, contacts, or messages to any cloud server. All data transfer happens directly between devices via a local Wi-Fi connection.

### B. Permissions & Usage
To function correctly, the app requires specific permissions:

*   **Location (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION):** Required by Android to use Wi-Fi Direct and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for discovering nearby devices. We **do not** track your physical location or share it with anyone.
*   **Storage (READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE):** Required to select files for sending and to save received files to your device.
*   **Camera:** Required solely for scanning QR codes to establish connections between devices.
*   **Installed Apps (QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES):** Required to list your installed applications so you can select and share them (APKs) with other devices.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

*   **File Transfer:** To facilitate the transfer of photos, videos, apps, and documents between devices you approve.
*   **Connection:** To discover and connect to nearby devices using Wi-Fi Direct and Bluetooth.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We **do not** sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your identifiable information to outside parties.
*   **No Cloud Uploads:** Your files never leave your local network.
*   **No Third-Party Tracking:** We do not use third-party analytics that track user behavior across apps.

## 4. Game Data (Android 11+)

For transferring game resources (OBB/Data), Mister Share uses the Android **Storage Access Framework (SAF)**.
*   Access is restricted to the specific game folder you explicitly select.
*   This access is used strictly for writing/restoring the game files you received.

## 5. Security

We implement security measures to maintain the safety of your information:
*   **Encryption:** All file transfers are encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., AES-256) during transit between devices.
*   **Local Processing:** All processing happens on your device.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
